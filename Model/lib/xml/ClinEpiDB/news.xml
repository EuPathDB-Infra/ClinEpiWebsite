        <h4><b>ClinEpiDB in India</b></h4>
        <ul>
		      <li>March 13 - 17th, the ClinEpiDB outreach team will be attending a conference and conducting a workshop in New Delhi, India. Here we'll be working with data providers and researchers to walk them through their data, teach them all the features of ClinEpiDB and discuss integration of future studies. As ClinEpiDB grows we will continue to conduct these workshops in various locations globally. Please do not hesitate to reach out to us if you are interested in learning more about our workshops at help@ClinEpiDB.org.</li>

      <section> <h4><b>New Data in this Release</b></h4>
		    <ul>
          <li>The Etiology, Risk Factors, and Interactions of Enteric Infections and Malnutrition and the Consequences for Child Health and Development (MAL-ED) Study was coordinated by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health and in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health's Fogarty International Center. This longitudinal cohort study was conducted at eight sites across three continents: Bangladesh, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Tanzania, South Africa, Peru and Brazil. 2145 children enrolled during the first 2 weeks after birth were followed for up to 5 years to better understand the complicated relationships among intestinal infections, nutrition and other environmental exposures early in life on child development. The children were continuously and carefully monitored for illness, enteric (gut) infections, immune responses to childhood vaccines, breastfeeding and other nutrient intakes, and cognitive development. In addition, information regarding a number of socioeconomic factors (such as water quality, household income and maternal education) were collected in and around each child's household to assess and compare overall living conditions. The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/a/app/record/dataset/DS_3dbf92dc05">MAL-ED study</a> provides some of the strongest evidence linking the burden of enteropathogens (gut bacteria, parasites and viruses), even in the absence of overt symptoms (especially diarrhea), to growth and developmental shortfalls in infancy and early childhood. The MAL-ED study of nutrient intake by young children in developing countries is among the most robust of its type ever conducted, and demonstrated the benefit of a diverse diet and one containing a significant amount of protein on growth and development. Most analytic data from the first 2 years of study are now available on ClinEpiDB.org. In the coming months, MAL-ED data from the full 5 years of study will also be made available.</li> 
		      <li><a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/a/app/record/dataset/DS_2a6ace17a1">Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) 1A</a>, coordinated by the University of Maryland School of Medicine's Center for Vaccine Development, was a one-year follow-on study in which six GEMS sites performed simultaneous case-control studies of both moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) and less severe diarrhea (LSD), and one GEMS site performed a case-control study of MSD only. The study enrolled 14,242 children under 5 years of age from seven sites in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.</li>
		      <li>The <a target="_blank" href="https://clinepidb.org/a/app/record/dataset/DS_05ea525fd3">India ICEMR longitudinal cohort study</a> was coordinated by the Center for the Study of Complex Malaria in India (CSCMi), part of the International Centers of Excellence for Malaria Research (ICEMR) program. The longitudinal study enrolled ~400 participants across 2 sites in India, in Rourkela, Odisha and Tamil Nadu, Chennai, and followed them over a period of 2 years. Two additional studies from CSCMi, including a cross-sectional study and fever surveillance study, will also be made available in the next few months.</li>

        <ul>
		<li>The analysis apps in the 'Analyze Results' tab of the results table have now been upated. There are still three apps available, Distributions, Contingency Tables, and Data Summaries but they have been redesigned to be easier to navigate and view results! Check them out!

      <section> <h4><b>New Data in this Release</b></h4>
		<ul>
        <li>The Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), coordinated by the University of Maryland School of Medicine's Center for Vaccine Development, was a case-control study conducted at seven diverse, high-burden sites in Asia and Africa: the Gambia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. The study enrolled 22,568 children under 5 years of age. GEMS is the largest, most comprehensive study of childhood diarrheal diseases ever conducted in developing country settings.  Results showed that most attributable cases of moderate-to-severe diarrhea were due to four pathogens: rotavirus, Cryptosporidium, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli producing heat-stable toxin (ST-ETEC; with or without co-expression of heat-labile enterotoxin), and Shigella. Truly a groundbreaking study in childhood infectious disease, the initial GEMS1 Case-Control data, including TaqMan Array Card molecular detection results, are now available on <a href="https://clinepidb.org/a/app/record/dataset/DS_841a9f5259">ClinEpiDB.org</a>. Exploring the data using the search wizard and analysis applications are open to all users; in order to download the data, investigators will be required to register and submit a data access request. About 1000 stool samples from GEMS1 have 16S sequence data available; results and more information about those samples can be found at our companion site <a href="http://microbiomedb.org/a/app/record/dataset/DS_bb7b589593">MicrobiomeDB.org</a>. In the coming months, the GEMS1A and heathcare utilization surveys that were conducted in concert with GEMS will also be made available.
