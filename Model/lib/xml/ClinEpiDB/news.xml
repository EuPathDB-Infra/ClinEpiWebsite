        <h4><b>New Features in this Release</b></h4>
        <ul>
		<li>The analysis apps in the 'Analyze Results' tab of the results table have now been upated. There are still three apps available, Distributions, Contingency Tables, and Data Summaries but they have been redesigned to be easier to navigate and view results! Check them out!
        
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section> <h4><b>New Data in this Release</b></h4>
		<ul>
        <li>The Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), coordinated by the University of Maryland School of Medicineâ€™s Center for Vaccine Development, was a case-control study conducted at seven diverse, high-burden sites in Asia and Africa: the Gambia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. The study enrolled 22,568 children under 5 years of age. GEMS is the largest, most comprehensive study of childhood diarrheal diseases ever conducted in developing country settings.  Results showed that most attributable cases of moderate-to-severe diarrhea were due to four pathogens: rotavirus, Cryptosporidium, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli producing heat-stable toxin (ST-ETEC; with or without co-expression of heat-labile enterotoxin), and Shigella. Truly a groundbreaking study in childhood infectious disease, the initial GEMS1 Case-Control data, including TaqMan Array Card molecular detection results, are now available on <a href="https://clinepidb.org/a/app/record/dataset/DS_841a9f5259">ClinEpiDB.org</a>. Exploring the data using the search wizard and analysis applications are open to all users; in order to download the data, investigators will be required to register and submit a data access request. About 1000 stool samples from GEMS1 have 16S sequence data available; results and more information about those samples can be found at our companion site <a href="http://microbiomedb.org/a/app/record/dataset/DS_bb7b589593">MicrobiomeDB.org</a>. In the coming months, the GEMS1A and heathcare utilization surveys that were conducted in concert with GEMS will also be made available.

        <h4><b>New Features in this Release</b></h4>
        <ul>
		<li>A News section and Twitter newsfeed have been added to our homepage to make update announcements easily accessible.
        <li>We have improved the layout and design of our analysis apps. The new format allows for easier variable selection, more-intuitive layout and figure presentation. We have also added to the number of facets or strata that can be selected for the data.
        <li>Protecting the data of research investigators and study participants is important to us. We have updated our 'Data Access and Use Policy' to reflect the different levels of data access offered to data providers and users. Please contact us for more information about how data access restrictions are implemented on ClinEpiDB.
		<li>In our 'Tutorials and Resources' section we have added a document that provides quick guidance for researchers when considering the complete lifecycle of data. It includes links to data sharing resources and some template language for putting together consent forms, IRB proposals, and amendments. 
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section> <h4><b>New Data in this Release</b></h4>
		<ul>
        <li>New data has been added to the PRISM cohort study. Participants from Nagongera were followed for another year from July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017. This addition to the dataset includes a few new participants, thousands of new observations, and new light trap data.
